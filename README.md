# Light Party

A very "vibe-coded" light experiment built with GitHub Copilot agent mode, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)!

## Prompting involved

Here's the prompting I did to get this started. I implemented a few smaller things on my own to improve fluidity of the light and some of the colors, but AI did most of the heavy lifting on the Three.js side:

```
Using ThreeJS, turn index.html into a light simulator. When you wave your mouse around on the page, glowing, colorful lights should follow it. The lights should feel fluid, almost, and fade away after a few seconds.

Let's add some more random rainbow colors to the lighting so it's not just white, and also make the trail a bit smoother (right now it's a little stiff). Maybe making it feel more "fluid" would be better, like if it dispersed a bit more.
```
